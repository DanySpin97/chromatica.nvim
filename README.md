# chromatica.nvim

A very experimental syntax highlight infrastructure for neovim. The first goal
of this project is to provide C/C++ syntax highlight through libclang. The
further goal is to extend this framework for other external highlighter.

This project is largely inspired by [deoplete][1], [Clamp][2] and
[color_coded][3] and has reused some codes/ideas from these projects.
